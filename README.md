### Datasets:
For the conducted research, three opensourced datasets, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of next-basket prediction task, were used: 
- **TaFeng**: contains 4 months of shopping transactions with 32,266 users and 23,812 items. This dataset is a Chinese grocery store dataset with numerous baskets of purchased items. Full dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chiranjivdas09/ta-feng-grocery-dataset) 
- **Instacart**: released on Instacart challenge, which contains over 3 million online purchases from more than 200,000 users. Full dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data) 
- **Dunnhumby** released by Dunnhumby, a business data processing and analysis company. It records more than 2 years of purchases of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. Full dataset can be found [here](https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files)
